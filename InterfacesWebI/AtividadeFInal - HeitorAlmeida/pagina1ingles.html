      <h2>What is Urban Mobility?</h2>
      <p>
        Urban mobility is the condition of moving from one point to another
        within a city.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the most commonly found definition, but also the most
        simplistic, reductionist, and literal one - as "mobility" refers to the
        ability to move, and "urban" refers to the city.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, the term urban mobility also refers to an area of knowledge
        and public management that takes into account a "need to be satisfied."
      </p>
      <p>
        This is what Diego Hernández, an expert in public transportation and
        urban mobility and a professor at the Catholic University of Uruguay,
        draws attention to in a video produced by the Development Bank of Latin
        America (CAF).
      </p>
      <iframe

      ></iframe>
      <p>
        According to Hernández, urban mobility is a system that exists to
        satisfy people's transportation needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this to happen, the work requires investments in infrastructure,
        good traffic management, and safety.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, it involves the diversification of transportation modes -
        road, waterway, and rail (underground or surface) - and their
        integration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, it is worth noting that urban mobility is not limited to travel
        time.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, traveling from one place to another by bicycle can be
        faster than by car (due to the ability to bypass congestion).
      </p>
      <p>
        However, without a bike lane or proper signage, cyclists will not feel
        safe to take the route.
      </p>
      <h2>Urban Mobility in Brazil</h2>
      <p>
        The Federal Constitution of Brazil states that road safety encompasses
        certain actions that "guarantee citizens the right to efficient urban
        mobility" (Article 144, paragraph 10, item I).
      </p>
      <p>This function is attributed to traffic agencies.</p>
      <p>
        The problem is that in the country, the notion of "traffic" is very
        limited to the practices of organizing the flow of motor vehicles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Traffic agencies are mainly concerned with the safety of drivers,
        passengers, cyclists, and pedestrians.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is undeniably a fundamental issue, but urban mobility is more than
        that, as we explained before.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this reductionist view, what ends up happening is that, for the
        government, urban mobility actions are restricted to road infrastructure
        projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Investments in public transportation, on the other hand, are often
        disconnected from this infrastructure planning.
      </p>

      <h2>Urban Mobility Law</h2>
      <p>
        The major problem with the mindset we have just discussed is the lack of
        understanding that all these issues need to be interconnected within a
        broader planning framework.
      </p>
      <p>
        Urban mobility is infrastructure, it is public transportation, and more.
        However, all of this needs to be considered together.
      </p>
      <p>
        A federal law passed in 2012 aims to address this problem: Law No.
        12,587, which establishes the guidelines for the National Urban Mobility
        Policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        This law determined that all municipalities in the country with more
        than 20,000 inhabitants needed to develop an Urban Mobility Plan and
        align it with the municipal master plan within six years from the law's
        enactment.
      </p>
      <p>According to Article 24, the plan must encompass:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Public collective transportation services</li>
        <li>Traffic circulation</li>
        <li>Urban mobility system infrastructure</li>
        <li>
          Urban mobility system infrastructure, including bike lanes and paths
        </li>
        <li>
          Accessibility for people with disabilities and mobility restrictions
        </li>
        <li>
          Integration of public transportation modes and their integration with
          private and non-motorized modes
        </li>
        <li>
          Operation and regulation of cargo transportation in the road
          infrastructure
        </li>
        <li>Trip-generating areas</li>
        <li>Public and private parking areas, whether free or paid</li>
        <li>
          Restricted or controlled access and circulation areas and schedules
        </li>
        <li>
          Mechanisms and instruments for financing public collective
          transportation and urban mobility infrastructure
        </li>
        <li>
          Systematic evaluation, review, and periodic updating of the Urban
          Mobility Plan within a period not exceeding ten years.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The final deadline for plan development was three years after the law's
        enactment, which would have been in 2015. However, a law published in
        2018 extended this deadline to 2019.
      </p>
      <p>
        Municipalities that fail to comply with this requirement are prohibited
        from receiving federal budgetary resources allocated to urban mobility.
      </p>
      <h2>Challenges Faced by the City</h2>
      <p>
        The city of São Paulo faces various challenges related to urban
        mobility, due to its size, population density, and unplanned growth over
        the years. Some of the main challenges include:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Traffic congestion: São Paulo has a high volume of vehicles
          circulating daily, resulting in constant traffic congestion on major
          city roads. Heavy traffic causes delays, stress, and negative impacts
          on air quality.
        </li>
        <li>
          Insufficient public transportation: Although São Paulo has an
          extensive public transportation network, including buses, subway, and
          trains, the demand is high, and often the supply is insufficient. This
          results in overcrowding, long waits, and discomfort for users.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lack of integration between transportation modes: The lack of
          efficient integration between different modes of public transportation
          hinders citizens' mobility. The lack of connectivity between buses,
          subway, and trains makes it difficult to make trips with modal
          transfers, leading to longer journeys.
        </li>
        <li>
          Inadequate infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians: The city faces
          challenges in terms of infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians.
          The lack of safe and well-signaled bike lanes makes it difficult to
          use bicycles as a means of transportation. Additionally, inadequate
          sidewalks and lack of accessibility compromise pedestrian mobility.
        </li>
        <li>
          Traffic safety: São Paulo has high rates of traffic accidents,
          including pedestrian accidents and collisions. Lack of respect for
          traffic rules, recklessness, and inadequate infrastructure contribute
          to insecurity on the city's roads.
        </li>
        <li>
          Inequality in the distribution of transportation services: Some more
          distant and peripheral neighborhoods have fewer options for public
          transportation, making it difficult for these communities to access
          essential services such as healthcare, education, and employment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pollution and environmental impacts: The intense traffic of vehicles
          contributes to air pollution, which negatively affects public health.
          In addition, greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector
          contribute to climate change.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        To address these challenges, the city of São Paulo has been implementing
        measures such as expanding the public transportation network, creating
        exclusive bus lanes, expanding the cycling infrastructure, adopting
        bike-sharing programs, and implementing traffic restrictions like
        vehicle rotation. Furthermore, promoting sustainable mobility solutions,
        such as incentivizing the use of electric vehicles, has also been
        discussed and implemented in the city.
